For a few years now I've been a silent sufferer of extreme stress. Summers & holidays spent off in my own mind with work and responsibilities. If I'm honest with  myself, the actual influences causing my stress is arguably trivial compared to [what many others take on](https://www.tesla.com/fi_FI/blog/master-plan-part-deux?redirect=no), but to steal from the infinitely entertaining [Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce): 

> To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish.
> <cite>An old, Yiddish proverb (apparently).</cite>

Clearly, the passive 'just let go' approach wasn't working, so I decided to educate myself a little. I re-watched Kelly McGonigal's [2013 TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend) on the reality behind stress. Most of us (myself included) are of the opinion that stress is to be avoided. Controlled. Minimized. Stress is the mind-killer. Stress kills creativity. 

Well, in a surprising twist, she explains to us the results of a significant US study:

> People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.
> <cite>Kelly McGonigal</cite>

Let's mull over that a little bit.  The study showed stress is associated with a 43% increased risk of dying due to heart disease - but only IF we believe it is bad for us. 

Wow.

## Fear is the mind-killer

Diving a little deeper, let's reason that we'd (normally) try to avoid things we believe are bad for us - yet from a mindfulness perspective, our insistent desire to escape our stressful situation is a rejection of our current reality - the moment. Good practice tells us that the way out of this trap is to acknowledge our present, stressful situation and move onwards accepting it - the courageous choice.

Now, there's a fine distinction here. As noble as marching bravely into the onslaught sounds - this hasn't actually helped us any. To us, it's still going to suck, but we're just going to do it anyway. The dread is still there. If we're to avoid the unhealthy physical response, a change in perception is necessary.

> ...in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage.
> <cite>Kelly McGonigal</cite>

The change in perception is actually in believing that stress is a *constructive* response. In my opinion, 'stress' is mostly about fear. Fear of failure. Fear of the consequences. So when we're talking about making peace with stress, I believe we're actually talking about making peace with fear.

And it's not as easy as just flipping a switch and realising, 'Oh, you mean it's good for us? Well that's alright then!' We need to devolve the idea of stress from our stalking enemy to a natural companion, an every-day part of our being.

That's some deep-seated emotional refactoring that needs to take place.

## Courage is the mind-maker

Yesterday, I was engaged in some light intellectualism (meaning: beer & hookahs) with a mate of mine here in Helsinki and I learned that he had also, at once stage, been a climber.  We took to talking about climbing, as good climbers do.

I love meeting other climbers because almost universally they're all people who have developed an [advanced relationship with fear](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/160103-honnold-climb-mountain-solo-adventure-ngbooktalk/). Alex Honnold, the psychotic beast-machine free-solo climber, is an extreme example of how far such a relationship can develop, but start climbing and quite soon you'll encounter the situation yourself.

> You're focused on the face above you. Your arm's stretched high overhead, gripping a jagged hold mercilessly. Your feet are placed precariously on alternate footholds, too awkward to give you a sense of comfort, yet too large to ignore and find another route. Above you is... nothing.  You crane your neck to inspect a crack and your loyal fingers start to betray you, uncoiling slowly. Your forearms burn.  You can't see the way forward. You pull yourself in towards the comforting solidarity of the rock, straining, but now you can't see anything. Where was that hold? Can you reach it? Is it any good?
>
> Your mortality rushes back into you. Adrenaline fills your veins.

Mostly, climbing is very calm, but in these moments, you're faced with a choice. Go for it, or give up. Fight or flight. Indoors, you're afforded that luxury - of flight. Even outdoors, to some degree, on sport climbs, you can reasonably rest on the rope with safety or come back down. 

But as you start to do more advanced climbing you will inevitably reach a situation where resting on the rope is no longer a reasonable thing to do. You don't actually know if it's safe - you're just testing the odds. There's no rescue chopper you can call to come get you. Your buddy Timmy is relying on you to finish it - on you fighting. 

Let me be clear about this - dealing with fear is not about removing fear. 

Fundamentally, climbing requires you to be present. But mostly importantly, it gives you the opportunity to [learn to deal with fear](https://rootsrated.com/stories/alex-honnold-adventure-fear) in a constructive way that doesn't break your presence. 

As you gradually deal with discomfort, you'll notice your attitude towards fear changing - and this becomes reflected in all things. It becomes easier to remain calm. You make more constructive choices. You don't shy away from discomfort. You accept difficult situations. Eventually, there's no adrenaline at all.

> A lot of people assume that I must be an adrenaline junkie, but climbing is actually very low adrenaline, because it is very slow.
> <cite>Alex Honnold</cite>
 
Through climbing, we can learn courage.

## Collaboration is the stress-breaker

There's another part to climbing - and that's the incredible vulnerability you'll have in your relationship with your climbing buddy, [Timmy](https://1001movienights.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/mav-and-goose.jpg).

There's a massive amount of trust to develop between you and Timmy, taking patience and mutual learning. It's probably going to be one of the most resilient relationships you'll have in your life, and this is absolutely no coincidence.
  
This is where my story comes full circle. Let's harken back to Kelly McGonigal's talk and listen to her next great reveal:

> To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone.
> 
> ...
>
> But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support.
> <cite>Kelly McGonigal</cite>

Okay, so *now* wow. Now we know why [Design Factory](http://designfactory.aalto.fi/) has [hugging points](https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6148/5973839310_07ccaf3db8_b.jpg) everywhere.  

I've always noticed that climbers from anywhere always seem to get along. There's every chance that if you met in any other setting you'd think [Timmy was a dick](/images/tim.png), but somehow through the emotional forge of climbing you're best of mates. None of this is any coincidence - through the rigours of climbing, you're body is pumping out enough oxytocin to make sure you can work together - to ensure you can collaborate. To rise above. To overcome. To climb upwards.
 
So here is my contention: Stress and collaboration are symbiotic.

Without stress, we can't effectively collaborate - the depth & meaningful engagement of team members with each other is limited.
Without collaboration, we can't effectively cope with stress - our body, flooded with oxytocin, is demanding support and connection.
   
The idea isn't new - team sports, hazing, military indoctrination and tribal coming-of-age ceremonies are all clearly composed of stresses and togetherness in order to form a bond.
 
Only we work in a creative industry, where collaboration is the cornerstone of success. There's no delusion about stress in innovation & entrepreneurship - pressure and ambiguity are some of the first characteristics we are made at home with. But there are much more elusive qualities that make an effective team. 

Like trust, vulnerability, & courage. 

Maybe those qualities are not so elusive, after all. Maybe they're not actually qualities that are supposed to be *found* in people, but *grown*. Maybe if we stop framing stress as the inescapable demon with which we are doomed to dance, creative collaboration can stop being such a dark art. Getting the idea? 

Stress is fundamental to meaningful collaboration.

## Stress and collaboration in symphony

Okay, so we're no stranger to tempering a small, intimate team with just the right amount of stress to keep a project rolling. One of the first admissions on the topic is that, "Some people just get off on stress." But what happens when you encounter *that* team member...?  You know, the one who just doesn't seem to cope and the harder you try with them, the worse it gets?

By no means is stress a magical potion that will transform your team into a collaborative hypercane - it should be obvious that stress can just as reasonably make us angry and defensive. 

Let's remember that learning to dealing with stress is mostly actually learning to deal with fear, and jump back to what we learned in our climbing.

> "A combination of factors makes people feel fear, then they assume that the fear means it’s dangerous."
> <cite>Alex Honnold</cite>

When we climb, we experience fear & discomfort. By putting ourselves in a fearful situation with controlled risk, we can gradually train our fear response to react with 'fight', not 'flight' - in other words, we train, out of life-threatening necessity, a natural response to engage with the task at hand, and not to give up. 

### Step 1. Tend & Befriend

Given a difficult situation, the climber might get frustrated, fed up and let go. They quit and come down to face disappointment. They might even tell themselves a story/softener to take the edge off. That's fine - a completely natural, textbook 'flight' response.

When I'm teaching new climbers I make a note to be as compassionate and hands off as possible at first. 
 - genuine praise (no false praise) - triggers reward system, releases dopamine. It's important  
 - no 'advice' unless asked for - encourages ownership, them to seek feedback, opening their mind. distraction free.
    - ever see those climbers giving their buddy 'tips' every 30 seconds?
 - criticism (eventually) one point at a time. As something to try/focus on, not something they're doing wrong. And give them time to focus on it. 
    - gives them focus, supports their presence & mindfulness.        
 - give them a high five, hug or arm around the shoulder after their climb - the physical contact helps release oxytocin (this may, or may not work with Finnish people).

I accept the fact that the majority of their instincts might be built around 'flight' and try to develop a strong relationship at first.

There's an equivalent to this in the world of psychology - it's called 'tend and befriend'. 

Dopamine, Oxytocin and Serotonin.

We'll get back to this. 

### Step 2. Apply Reasonable Pressure

As the complexity of the climbing increases, so do the stakes and that 'flight' option starts to become less and less appealing. 
The trouble is that in those difficult moments, if your instinct is 'flight' you're running the risk of testing the rope. 

> ...when your mind is telling you you’re done, you’re really only 40 percent done.
> <cite>some Navy SEAL</cite>
 
When you test that rope and take that chance - you bloody well want to make sure there was nothing else you could do. 

Mostly, that kind of mentality doesn't come naturally, it has to be nurtured. So, at some stage in the relationship, I start to put the pressure on.  This is what makes a good climbing buddy - they don't let you fall back into your comfort zones until you've pushed yourself. Enough of this and gradually you start to realise how much you're actually capable of. 

Only when relationship is solid - they aren't doing it because you 'told them to', now they're doing it because it's you.

Tend & Befriend in action > When 'tending and befriending' relationships develop that overcome fight/flight responses.
Pressure on > they produce courage. And we already know that courage produces engagement a 'fight' response.

Think of a mother bear, protecting her cubs.

 - Always give them a reason in the grand scheme, in progress why you're pushing them.  When you do X you'll need Y, when you go lead, when you go outdoors, when you do an overhang, when you do trad.

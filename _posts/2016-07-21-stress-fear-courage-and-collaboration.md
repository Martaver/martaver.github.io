For a few years now I've been a silent sufferer of elevated stress. Summers & holidays spent off in my own mind with work and responsibilities. If I'm honest with myself, the actual influences causing my stress are arguably trivial compared to [what many others take on](https://www.tesla.com/fi_FI/blog/master-plan-part-deux?redirect=no) but, to steal from the infinitely entertaining [Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce): 

> To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish.
> <cite>An old, Yiddish proverb (apparently).</cite>

Clearly, the passive 'just let go' approach to stress management wasn't working, so I decided to educate myself a little. I re-watched Kelly McGonigal's [2013 TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend) on the reality behind stress. Most of us (myself included) are of the opinion that stress is to be avoided. Controlled. Minimized. Stress is the mind-killer. Stress kills creativity. 

Well, in a surprising twist, she explains to us the results of a significant US study:

> People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.
> <cite>Kelly McGonigal</cite>

Let's mull over that a little bit.  The study showed stress is associated with a 43% increased risk of dying - but only IF we believe it is bad for us. 

Wow.

## Fear is the mind-killer

From a mindfulness perspective, our desire to escape our stressful situation is a rejection of our current reality - the moment. Good practice tells us that the way out of this trap is to acknowledge our present, stressful situation and move onwards accepting it - the courageous choice.

Now, there's a fine distinction here. As noble as marching bravely into the onslaught sounds - this hasn't actually helped us any. To us, it's still going to suck, but we're just going to do it anyway. The dread is still there. If we're to cheat death, a change in perception is necessary.

> ...in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage.
> <cite>Kelly McGonigal</cite>

The change is actually in believing that stress is a *constructive* response. In my opinion, 'stress' is mostly about fear. Fear of failure. Fear of the consequences. So when we're talking about making peace with stress, I believe we're actually talking about making peace with fear.

And it's not as easy as just flipping a switch and realising, "Oh, you mean it's good for us? Well that's alright then!" We need to devolve the idea of stress from our stalking enemy to a natural companion, an every-day part of our being.

That's some deep-seated emotional refactoring that needs to take place.

## Courage is the mind-maker

Yesterday, I was engaged in some light intellectualism (meaning: beer & hookahs) with a mate of mine here in Helsinki and I learned that he had also, at once stage, been a climber. So we took to talking about climbing, as good climbers do.

I love meeting other climbers because almost universally they're all people who have developed an [advanced relationship with fear](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/160103-honnold-climb-mountain-solo-adventure-ngbooktalk/). Alex Honnold, the psychotic beast-machine free-solo climber, is an extreme example of how far such a relationship can develop, but start climbing and quite soon you'll encounter the relationship yourself.

*Your arm's stretched high overhead, gripping a jagged hold mercilessly. Your feet are placed awkwardly on alternate footholds. Above you is... nothing.  You crane your neck as your loyal fingers start to betray you, uncoiling slowly. Your forearms burn.  Where was that hold? Can you reach it? Is it any good?*

*Your mortality rushes back into you. Adrenaline fills your veins.*

Mostly, climbing is very calm, but in these moments, you're faced with a choice. Go for it, or give up. Fight or flight. Indoors, you're afforded the luxury of flight. Even outdoors, to some degree, on sport climbs, you can reasonably rest on the rope with safety and come back down. 

But as you start to do more advanced climbing you will inevitably reach a situation where resting on the rope is no longer a reasonable thing to do. You don't actually know if it's safe - you're just testing the odds. There's no rescue chopper you can call to come get you and your buddy Timmy is relying on you to finish it - on you fighting.

Let me be clear about this - dealing with fear is not about removing fear. 

Fundamentally, climbing requires you to be present. But mostly importantly, it gives you the opportunity to [learn to deal with fear](https://rootsrated.com/stories/alex-honnold-adventure-fear) in a constructive way that doesn't break your presence. 

As you gradually deal with discomfort, you'll notice your attitude towards fear changing - and this becomes reflected in all things. It becomes easier to remain calm. You make more constructive choices. You don't shy away from discomfort. You accept difficult situations. Eventually, there's no adrenaline at all.

> A lot of people assume that I must be an adrenaline junkie, but climbing is actually very low adrenaline, because it is very slow.
> <cite>Alex Honnold</cite>
 
Through climbing, we can learn courage.

## Collaboration is the stress-breaker

There's another part to climbing - and that's the incredible vulnerability you'll have in your relationship with your climbing buddy, [Timmy](https://1001movienights.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/mav-and-goose.jpg). 

It's probably going to be one of the most resilient relationships you'll have in your life and there's a reason why. This is where my story comes full circle. Let's harken back to Kelly McGonigal's talk and listen to her next great reveal:

> To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone.
> 
> ...
>
> But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support.
> <cite>Kelly McGonigal</cite>

Okay, so *now* wow. Now we know why [Design Factory](http://designfactory.aalto.fi/) has [hugging points](https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6148/5973839310_07ccaf3db8_b.jpg) everywhere.  

I've always noticed that climbers from anywhere always seem to get along. There's every chance that if you met in any other setting you'd think [Timmy was a dick](/images/tim.png), but through the rigours of climbing, you're body is pumping out oxytocin to make sure you can work together - to ensure you can collaborate. To rise above. To overcome. To climb upwards.
 
So here is my contention: Stress and collaboration are symbiotic.

**Without stress, we can't effectively collaborate**. The depth & meaningful engagement of team members with each other is limited.

**Without collaboration, we can't effectively cope with stress**. Our body, flooded with oxytocin, is demanding support and connection.
   
The idea isn't new - team sports, hazing, military indoctrination and tribal coming-of-age ceremonies are all clearly composed of stresses and togetherness in order to form bonds.
 
There's no delusion about stress in innovation & entrepreneurship - pressure and ambiguity are some of the first characteristics we are made at home with. But there are much more elusive qualities that make an effective team. 

Like trust, vulnerability, & courage. 

Maybe they're not actually elusive qualities that are *found* in people, but *grown*. If we can stop framing stress as the inescapable demon with which we are doomed to dance, creative collaboration can stop being such a dark art. Getting the idea? 

Stress is fundamental to meaningful collaboration.

## Stress and collaboration in symphony

Okay, so we're no stranger to tempering a small, intimate team with just the right amount of stress to keep a project rolling. One of the first admissions on the topic is that, "Some people just get off on stress." But what happens when you encounter *that* team member...?  You know, the one who just doesn't seem to cope and the harder you try with them, the worse it gets?

By no means is stress a magical potion that will transform your team into a collaborative hypercane - it should be obvious that stress can just as reasonably make us angry and defensive. 

Let's remember that learning to dealing with stress is mostly actually learning to deal with fear, and jump back to what we learned in our climbing.

> "A combination of factors makes people feel fear, then they assume that the fear means itâ€™s dangerous."
> <cite>Alex Honnold</cite>

When we climb, we experience fear & discomfort. By putting ourselves in a fearful situation with controlled risk, we can gradually train our fear response to react with 'fight', not 'flight' - in other words, we train a natural response to *engage* rather than to give up. 

### Step 1. Tend & Befriend

When I'm teaching new climbers I make a note to be as compassionate and hands off as possible:

 - *Let them down when they want to.* You're building trust, so keep them comfortable.
 - *Only give genuine praise.* Don't give them false or petty praise - it'll drown out the good stuff.
 - *No 'advice' unless asked for.* Keep their mind clear. Have you ever seen those climbers giving their buddy 'tips' every 30 seconds?  
 - *Show them one thing at a time.* Keep their mind clear. When advice or critique (eventually) comes up, don't vomit a list of problems onto their lap.
 - *High fives and hugs* Give them a high five, hug or arm around the shoulder after their climb.
 
I accept the fact that the majority of their instincts are usually built around 'flight' and try to develop a strong relationship instead. There's an equivalent to this bonding behavior in the world of psychology - it's called 'tend and befriend' and while doing it, it releases Dopamine, Oxytocin and Serotonin.

For example, in the rules above, praise triggers the brain's reward system and releases Dopamine and the physical contact releases Oxytocin (this may or may not work with Finnish people).

We'll get back to this in a sec. 

In a difficult situation, a climber might get frustrated, let go and come down to face disappointment. They might even tell themselves a story/softener to take the edge off. That's fine at first - a completely natural response. But as the complexity of the climbing increases, we really can't afford to test the rope unnecessarily anymore   

> ...when your mind is telling you youâ€™re done, youâ€™re really only 40 percent done.
> <cite>some Navy SEAL</cite>
 
That kind of mentality to push further can be nurtured. That's what makes a good climbing buddy - they pushed you and eventually you discover how far you can go.

### Step 2. Apply Reasonable Pressure

When it's clear that our bond is strengthening and climbing is important to them, I start to apply some pressure. Not all the time. You don't want to be the asshole who never lets you down when you ask for it.

The process is simple:

1. Wait for a climb that's important to them.
2. If they 'give up', don't let them down.

and, if necessary:

3. Relate it to the next climbing achievement. 

The first point is important because it makes the pressure *about them*. They keep ownership even though you're pushing them. It's their project.

But they also push themselves because you're there. Psychologically, this is the response to 'Tend & Befriend' in action.  You see, the result of all that Dopamine, Oxytocin and Serotonin is an emotional connection with you that reduces fear and promotes courage in stressful situations. It's what converts a 'flight' into a 'fight'.

Think of a mother bear, protecting her cubs. Without her cubs, it makes sense for the mother to flee, but around her cubs - there's no question - she'll fight.

The third point places their effort in the context of progress - you need this 'for overhangs', 'for leading', 'for outdoors', 'for trad' etc. This doesn't just give them a reason for pushing, but it progresses them through a narrative with which they identify.

> <cite>[Harvard Business Review, 2010](https://hbr.org/2010/01/the-hbr-list-breakthrough-ideas-for-2010)</cite>

### Fostering Engagement In Collaborative Teams

Let's distill all this into some rules of thumb on how to nurture meaningful engagement in a collaborative team.

Your modus operandi should be 'Tend & Befriend'. It cultivates the emotional energy you need to be successful when you apply pressure.

 - **Be flexible.** Take breaks, chill, have barbecues.
 - **Only give genuine praise.**
 - **No criticism unless called for.**
 - **One improvement at a time.**
 - **Hugs!** (of course)

When you apply pressure, be respectful of the stress you're creating.

 - **Be selective.** Pick something they care about. Make it personal.
 - **Reject the first version.** Make them improve it, one iteration at a time.
 - **Be ready to explain** why the pressure is constructive. 

It's important to realise that this isn't a formula to be applied when your project is in a state of emergency. By then, the damage is done. 

The goal here is to *make a habit* of choosing 'fight' instead of 'flight', engagement over disengagement, when it comes to stress. 

It's a long-term game, but it's worth it.

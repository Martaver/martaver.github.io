[Minko Gechev's blog](http://blog.mgechev.com/) has had [some](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/06/26/tree-shaking-angular2-production-build-rollup-javascript/) [interesting](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/07/21/even-smaller-angular2-applications-closure-tree-shaking/) [articles](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/08/14/ahead-of-time-compilation-angular-offline-precompilation/) recently about ng2's Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler and production build stacks. He describes two typical stacks making use of ng2's AOT compilation step.

Normally, angular 1 and the platform-browser-dynamic use Just-in-time compilation (JIT), which means both ng2 and your app payload are sent to the client's browser and compiled before running. 

AOT compilation happens with `ng2c`, which pre-compiles all ng2 code during your build, instead of client-side, to save clients time with payload size and initialization.

Traditional build steps to reduce ng2-hello-world to `49kb`:

1. AOT Compile
2. Tree-shake
3. Bundle
4. Minify
5. Compress

Should be familiar to everyone who's done a production build - but more steps mean more tools, more decision and more variation between developers. I like standardisation and reducing decision fatigue, so...

Advanced build steps to reduce ng2-hello-world to `20kb`:

1. AOT Compile
2. Google Closure Compiler
3. Compress

[Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) (GCC) takes the place of the 'Tree shake', 'Bundle' and 'Minify' steps with Google's magic, equal parts cryptic and genius.

**The problem**: Currently GCC doesn't support ECMA2016 modules perfectly and, since that's what ng2c emits - we have a problem.  Nevertheless, there's [an open issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8550) working to shoehorn ng2 into GCC. It's scheduled for release for [angular 2.1.0](https://github.com/angular/angular/milestone/61), so it's a race between GCC updating to support ECMA2016 and 2.1's shoehorn hack to get it working.

This it's very exciting to have a best-of-class tool to squash our code into it's functional minimum with a single cmd.

Eagerly watching the progress.

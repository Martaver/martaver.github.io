Fredericka the Great : 'Prototype' This font reflects the sketchy, prototypical style used during mock-ups, presentations.

IM Fell English, IM Fell English SC : 'Storytelling' These fonts reflect a formally typed style yet projecting a huge amount of storytelling character.

Permanent Marker, Rock Salt : Slightly retro, yet referencing the freehand post-it note nature of creative work.

We still need a font that can cover 'normal' text, with all variants of black, bold, regular, light and thin styles.
